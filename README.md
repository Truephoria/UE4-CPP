# UE4-CPP
Just a hodgepodge of different coding projects for Unreal Engine C++.

I'll be periodically uploading code for things I find fun, funny, or useful for games or other apps. It's all (UE4) C++, so as you programmers know, there are some syntax differences. If you're used to coding in C++, you won't have too much of a hard time refactoring, but if you're using UE4, just add the files to your game/project folder inside your SOURCE folder. The folder path should look something like: UE4ProjectsFolder->YourUE4ProjectName->Source->YourUE4ProjectName. 

**If that doesn't work, the work-around, is to add CREATE a C++ file from the UE4 Editor FIRST. Then you can add the code to the newly created files.

**IF YOU'RE A BLUEPRINT ONLY PROGRAMMER: I will be making the projects in both Blueprints and C++, so you can choose which you prefer.

*I'll put the link up for the BPs as soon as they're hosted somewhere

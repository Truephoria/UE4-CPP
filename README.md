# UE4-CPP
Just a hodgepodge of different coding projects for Unreal Engine C++.

I'll be periodically uploading code for things I find fun, funny, or useful for games or other apps. It's all (UE4) C++, so as you programmers know, there are some syntax differences. If you're used to coding in C++, you won't have too much of a hard time refactoring, but if you're using UE4, these code snippets should work right away. 

IF YOU'RE A BLUEPRINT ONLY PROGRAMMER: I will be making the projects in both Blueprints and C++, so you can choose which you prefer.

*I'll put the link up for the BPs as soon as they're hosted somewhere
